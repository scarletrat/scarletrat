### 👋 About Me

<p align="left">
I'm an **Electrical Engineering student** at **Rutgers University – New Brunswick**.
</p>

🔬 I’m currently conducting **research in Spectral Analysis**, focusing on efficient signal representation and frequency-domain techniques.  

💻 I’ve taken courses such as **Data Structures**, **Software Methodology**, and **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence** in the Computer Science department, where I learned to apply **Java** and **Python** in problem-solving and algorithmic design.  

⚙️ I’ve also completed **Embedded Systems I**, where I worked with **VHDL** to design and simulate hardware logic.
